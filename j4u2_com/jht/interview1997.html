          <p class="bodytext11"><b>Background</b></p>
          <p align="left">Peek beneath the hood of Macromedia Director and you
          find Lingo, a complete scripting language that gives the world's most
          popular authoring tool much of its power. While many people have
          worked on Lingo, one man - its chief architect, John Thompson - can be
          credited not just for the original vision also for developing and
          refining the language over the years. Authoring Media caught up with
          JT, as he is usually called, in Melbourne where he spoke at a number
          of sessions at the recent Macromedia User Conference Asia 97.</p>
          <p class="blueheader" align="left"><b>anm: Could you tell us a little
          bit about your background and what led you to designing a multimedia
          scripting language?</b></p>
          <p align="left">JT: I studied computer science at MIT where my main
          interest was in computer languages, particularly LISP which is a
          symbolic rather than a numerical language embodying concepts such as
          ease-of-use and accessibility. I really enjoyed getting into that but
          I also had this other desire to be expressive. I was always drawing
          and painting in my spare time and I hadn't done much of that since
          high school. So midway through college <img border="0" src="images/resume_85jtnyc.jpg" width="199" height="191" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4">I
          just took some time off and went back to New York and studied drawing
          and painting for a year and a half. And I learnt a lot about those
          skills, and also saw that I could combine my interest in computer
          languages, computers in general, and visual expression.</p>
          <p align="left">So in 1981, I went back to MIT and focused on that
          crossover. I studied with Muriel Cooper in the Visual Language
          Workshop where the emphasis was on creating tools that were geared for
          designers rather than technicians. And at the same time I was working
          with ArcMac (The Architecture Machine Lab, now the MIT MediaLab) which
          was concerned with creating information systems that were very
          accessible, how to navigate through a lot of information in new and
          interesting ways, using large screens, multi-sensory stuff. I was
          drawn to that because what I felt was exciting was this issue of how
          can you take this very powerful computer and make it more accessible
          to creative people, and that's what I like to see.</p>
          <p class="blueheader" align="left"><b>anm: When did you first join
          MacroMind?</b></p>
          <p align="left">I saw some of the graphical user interface approaches
          that were being pioneered by the Lisa and that seemed more exciting. I
          was interested in art anyway, so I said hey this is probably the place
          to go. In 1985 I left my instructor's position at MIT to work at
          LucasFilm on non-linear editing systems. From there I got hooked up
          with Marc Canter at MacroMind through some friends of his who were
          working at LucasFilm. I wanted to get on to the Macintosh which I saw
          as a great computer so I started by doing the VideoWorks Accelerator
          which was a pre-QuickTime technology to play animations faster. Then I
          did the Paint program in Director.</p>
          <p align="left">Now for a while there the company was focused on a
          product called 3D Works and I had an opportunity just to have free
          reign over where Director should go, so I just plugged Lingo into
          Director 2.0 and again the goal was to create an environment, drawing
          on what I did creatively which is build a fluid tool, a tool that was
          expandable, was expressive and had a lot of power. And since I knew
          about powerful interpretive languages and how to implement them, I
          added a scripting language to Director.</p>
          <p class="blueheader" align="left"><b>anm: What were your influences
          in developing that first version of Lingo?</b></p>
          <p align="left">JT: The biggest influences in terms of implementation
          were LISP and SmallTalk and in terms of the syntax it was HyperTalk,
          the HyperCard scripting language, because that was the first language
          designed specifically for non programmers. And I admire that concept.
          Overall Lingo has always been a synthesis, in that it tries to take in
          the best of what's out there in order to get closer towards the goal
          of creating a powerful, expressive, accessible tool. One of the things
          that kills a lot of software development is that it tries to be overly
          ambitious and then you get a tool that's too late to address the real
          needs of people. I was able to avoid that by firstly having a clear
          vision of what was needed to go into a very accessible, high
          performance language. And, secondly by accepting the fact that you can
          only implement so much within the software development cycle.</p>
          <p align="center"><b><img border="0" src="images/intv97_funkey.gif" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="250" height="116"></b></p>
          <p align="left">Now I'd be the first to admit that Director isn't
          perfect but I think what we actually do extremely well is that we do
          iterative revisions and we listen to our customers and we
          systematically attempt to solve the problems that matter to them. I
          could go on for hours about these beautiful dreams of scalable
          presentation, multiple points of view of editing code, and so on, but
          we have to deal with the current issues of the marketplace: providing
          cross-platform playback, making it possible to play back content on
          the Web so it's a balancing act. But underlying all of that is a
          desire to make programming a lot more accessible and easier for non
          programmers.</p>
          <p class="blueheader" align="left"><b>anm: Who then do you see as the
          primary audience for Director?</b></p>
          <p align="left">JT: That's easy. It's definitely the creative
          professional who is not a programmer. Now we do want to provide
          scalable power, so we're going to put in powerful features that
          professional programmers can take advantage of and run with. We're not
          going to take that away. But the main idea is to provide a path where
          a creative professional can come in and, if they have the time and the
          skills, they'll be able to use Lingo to create new interactive
          experiences, because you can't get away from it, you have to script to
          create those experiences.</p>
          <p align="left">And I feel that there is a definite different type of
          content that you get out of somebody whose primary motivation is
          expression versus coding. Because what's exciting for me in multimedia
          is expression and that for me is philosophically very satisfying
          because you are enabling people who wouldn't have touched a computer
          before to express themselves in ways they could never have imagined.</p>
          <p align="left">I get a lot of thrills from coming to conferences like
          this and having people come up and shake my hand and say: <img border="0" src="images/lws_1itl_icon.jpg" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="132" height="185">&quot;Thank
          you for creating the language or writing the book because now I can
          understand this stuff and I'm using it to make something.&quot; I've
          seen people over the years develop their careers around Director and
          do what they want to do and be happy about it and get paid and then
          grow with the tool. Even now with the Director Java solution, people
          can say: &quot;Hey, I can still work in this environment that I'm very
          comfortable with but now when people say they need Java, I can provide
          a solution.&quot; So they can take advantage of the power of Java
          without getting into the headaches of learning a new language. That's
          what I like to see.</p><br><br>
