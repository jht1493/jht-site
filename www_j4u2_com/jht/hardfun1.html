          <p class="bodytext11" align="left"><b>Computer games AND schoolwork</b></p>
          <p align="left">Have you ever wondered why kids who rebel at doing
          homework can play video games for hours on end? We are puzzled
          especially when considering that the skills needed to master a video
          game are the same skills needed for educational pursuits -- problem
          solving, communicating with other players, and developing strategies.
          Schoolwork that's perceived as difficult does not interest them, yet
          hard games requiring the same skills enchant them. Why is that so and
          what can we do?</p>
          <p align="left">I'm calling this article &quot;Hard Fun&quot;, because
          no youth would spend any time on a game that did not challenge him or
          her to the limit. A young person typically invests over 40 hours to
          master a video game. That investment of time lets us know what
          dedication kids can apply when properly motivated.</p>
          <p align="left">My mission is to build on that interest in computer
          games so students can be as good in academics as they are in computer
          games. With the right direction, our student's enthusiasm for computer
          games can be extended to academic achievement. First students can
          discuss games why they enjoy them. Students can develop their
          analytical skills by reflecting and sharing their experience playing
          games. Then students can study how computer games are constructed and
          make &quot;pen and paper&quot; designs of new games. This reverse
          engineering can make academic studies more relevant. They can then
          build computer games of their own design in a practical application of
          their math, writing, and problem solving skills.</td>

          to explain why children learn more by doing, as opposed to abstract
          rote learning. Paula Hooper, a Ph.D. graduate of MIT, is using
          &quot;constructivism learning&quot; with an African-centered community
          school, Paige Academy in Boston. The school was &quot;organized to
          support a problem-solving approach to learning, with extensive
          reliance on the arts as a natural form of expression and
          exploration&quot;.</td>

          <p align="left">A student named Shamia learned how to make a rainbow
          by writing a computer program that automatically drew half-circles. In
          the process she learned about fractions, angles and geometry, not
          because she set out to, but because she was determined to make her
          rainbow. Shamia used a computer program called <a href="http://www.lcsi.ca" target="_blank">Logo</a>
          to make the problems concrete and meaningful. Logo was designed by
          Professor Papert to enable young students to build things and in the
          process apply abstract concepts in math and programming.</p>
          <p align="left">Enlightening uses of interactive media really excite
          me as a developer of interactive media tools. Lingo, the computer
          programming language behind Shockwave, allows creative people who may
          not be technically oriented to create interactive experiences for the
          Internet. Lingo permits more people to express themselves without
          being limited by their knowledge of programming. Can students use
          Lingo and Shockwave to build their own games? First let's get a better
          understanding of why games are so popular.</p>
          <p class="bodytext11" align="left"><b>What works</b></p>
          <p align="left">Let's briefly examine the popular game Pokemon that is
          all the rage. The cartridge plays on a $70 portable computer equipped
          with captivating sound, animation, and color. The developers of
          Pokemon succeed in breaking challenges into small pieces that keep the
          player involved for the 80 to 120 hours it takes to collect the 150
          Pokemon characters. At every stage, &quot;Professor Oak&quot; is
          available to explain what is happening. The player gains a sense of
          accomplishment by &quot;training&quot; each character. Once trained,
          the Pokemon characters are traded with other trainers. Players
          practice economics by winning &quot;dollars&quot; that are traded for
          Pokemon accessories such as vehicles, tickets, ropes, maps and other
          tools required to surmount the challenges. A marketing blitz of
          must-have trading cards, board games and toys supplement the computer
          game.</p>
          <p align="left">Every level of Pokeman presents new challenges, new
          scenarios, new characters and new hurdles that the player must
          overcome in new ways. The tasks become more difficult as the player
          progresses. There is constant immediate feedback on performance using
          negative and positive reinforcement. Players share their experiences
          with their friends and help each other beat the game by swapping
          strategies.</p>
          <p class="bodytext11" align="left"><b>What parents can do</b></p>
          <p align="left">Parents can translate Pokeman or any other computer
          game mania into academics by encouraging children to discuss various
          games so that they can describe, analyze, and compare the thinking
          processes, strategies and mechanics employed in the games. You may be
          surprise at the depth of knowledge your children have about their
          games. By talking about it both you and your child will be more aware
          of the mental discipline required to move up the levels in a game. A
          child is discouraged by challenging work at school can be encouraged
          by pointing out their demonstrated ability in beating a game.</p>
          <p align="left">Children naturally include what they enjoy in their
          creative drawing and story-making. My sons (age 9 &amp; 7) draw and
          write to augment Pokeman characters and recreate game scenarios. They
          avidly trade cards and calculate points. Their imaginations will not
          allow them to blindly digest Pokeman as it is, they are compelled to
          add their own flavor. Parents can encourage the naturally tendency for
          children to envision their own versions of computer games. You can
          explain to them that there is an entire industry behind the game
          itself and they can aspire to a career as a game maker. In future
          articles I will describe the various career options in the game
          development industry and what school preparation is needed.</p>
          <p class="bodytext11" align="left"><b>What schools can learn</b></p>
          <p align="left" class="bodytext">One of the differences between
          academic achievement and computer game mastery is the immediate reward
          for meeting the small progressive challenges in computer games. In
          school, the rewards have less immediate value and require long range
          vision to realize the tangible benefits. However, the long-term
          process of game development more closely mirrors the persevering road
          to real life success while still dispensing the immediate
          reinforcement of games. Another difference is the audio, visual and
          kinesthetic sensory neurological links that computer games stimulate.
          Traditional academics do not make use of these neural pathways. By
          building games students can learn with a greater variety of senses. Of
          course, just as instruments are needed for writing, new tools are
          needed for creating computer games.</p>

          </p>
          <p align="left">Shockwave is the primary way to present interactive
          games on the Internet. The majority of web users have already
          encountered Shockwave. What is not widely known is Shockwave can be a
          used by young people to create interactive material, such a games.
          Let's take a closer look at the three facets of Shockwave. The first
          the web site <a href="http://www.shockwave.com" target="_blank">www.shockwave.com</a>,
          where people can enjoy free games, cartoons and music in the same
          manner that one can now tune a radio to receive freely broadcast
          music.</p>
          <p align="left">The second facet is Shockwave, the player. The
          Shockwave player is a means of viewing interactive material such as
          games. Disney, America Online, Microsoft and other companies use the
          Shockwave format to play interactive media. Much the same way that one
          can now choose between cassette and CD audio formats, The Shockwave
          format consists of animation, graphics, and sound that can be played
          in a straight linear mode. Shockwave's Lingo computer language makes
          possible on-screen buttons that the user clicks to alter the sequence
          of events just as the remote control permits the user to program a CD
          player.</p>
          <p align="left">The third facet is the Shockwave Construction kit for
          students. With it a student can create their own games, improve
          existing games, or build an interactive illustration of a homework
          assignment. Students can integrate visual arts, music, and movement
          into their academic subjects using Shockwave. The kit is a special
          version of the same Macromedia Director program used by over 300,000
          professionals to create games and other interactive content. Students
          now have access to the same powerful tool used to create material for
          the www.shockwave.com web site. To learn how to use the kit students
          can start with the documentation and tutorials that come with the kit.
          They can also use of the several dozen books on the topic (search for
          &quot;Macromedia Director&quot; on the www.amazon.com web site). There
          are also many web sites, such as my own www.JohnHenry1.com, that
          provide advise and learning examples.</p>
          <p align="left">Finding information about the kit is a bit of a
          challenge. It is buried on the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com" target="_blank">www.macromedia.com</a>
          web site under the code name &quot;Director 7 K-12 Edition.&quot;
          Challenge a young person who loves computer games and has access to
          the Internet to move to the next level by getting this kit and
          creating their own games.</p>
          <p class="bodytext11" align="left"><b>The Next Level</b></p>
          <p align="left">Students have three powerful strategies for learning
          from computer games. They can discuss and analyze the games they
          enjoy. Using simple pen and paper they can design their own games.
          Finally, they can turn their game sketches into the real thing using
          the Shockwave construction kit.</p>
          <p align="left">To give direction and focus to the aspiring game
          creator, in the next installment I give a behind the scenes view of
          the game industry and what skills are needed on a game development
          team.</p>
