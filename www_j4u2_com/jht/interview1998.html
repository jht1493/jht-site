          <p class="blueheader" align="left"><b>DOUG: What is your background
          &amp; what brought you to Macromedia?</b></p>
          <p align="left">JT: I started programming back in high school using
          Basic. One of my teachers knew I was interested in computers and
          helped me get a job at a research facility in New York. There, I
          taught myself PL1, Fortran, Cobol, and something called JCL. I had a
          fascination with computer languages so I was determined to learn as
          many of them as possible and figure out how to build them.
          <p align="left">I went to MIT &amp; majored in Computer Science, with
          a minor in Visual Arts. I have always been interested in marrying
          visual things with computers, <img border="0" src="images/colorbars_mini.gif" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="151" height="114">so
          I hung out at MIT's Media Lab... working on personal projects. This
          interest was reinforced by some work I was doing with a company called
          LCS. We worked on some video games, including the first dual-video
          disk game. We were also working on some graphic tools. The idea was to
          do something like MacPaint for DOS -- we called it TelePaint, and it
          was going to be part of a graphics suite called &quot;TeleVision&quot;.
          <p align="left">All along, I was working with the link between visuals
          and computers. I was doing some work with video and 3D special
          effects. That led to my move to the west coast to work for Droid
          Works, which was a division of LucasFilm. They were focused on
          creating the first non-linear editing system for film and video,
          called Edit Droid. I was hired to write the machine control between
          the editor's control pad and the stacks of laser disk machines that
          were part of the system. Each playback machine was linked in with a
          single board computer and the whole system was driven by a Sun
          workstation.
          <p align="left">Ever since seeing Apple's &quot;Lisa&quot; computer, I
          had been interested in Apple computers. I really wanted to do some
          consulting work for Mac stuff. The husband of a friend at DroidWorks
          got me connected to Marc Canter and Macromind. I joined Macromind in
          1987 as one of six engineers.
          <p class="blueheader" align="left"><b>DOUG: What were you hired to do
          at Macromind?</b>
          <p align="left">JT: Marc hired me to write an accelerator to improve
          the playback performance of animation. Then I worked on the color
          paint program for Director (1).
          <p class="blueheader" align="left"><b>DOUG: You're often referred to
          as the &quot;father of Lingo&quot;. Tell us about your original
          objectives for Lingo.</b>
          <p align="left">JT: I had always been interested in languages, all the
          way back in high school. I wrote my first Basic interpreter in high
          school, and wrote two full blown Lisp intrepretor and compiler in
          college. So I had that background. At the same time, I was working on
          some personal projects where I wanted to have interactive control of
          video disks, but I wanted to control them with Director. So I wrote an
          xobject to do it and made that work and Lingo just grew from there.
          <p align="left">Most of the interactive programs for the Mac were
          being done in HyperCard, using HyperTalk for scripting. I wanted to
          bring that interactivity to Director. Where the focus of Director had
          originally been visual stuff, in Director 2 we wanted to add the
          capability to do interactive simulations for sales and training. And
          maybe some simple games. Lingo at that time was very simple, like
          integer arithmetic, small stuff.
          <p align="left">We were competing with HyperCard and HyperTalk, but
          Director was more free-format than the card-based authoring. A lot of
          Lingo was modeled after HyperTalk... handlers, events targeted to
          objects, and a scripting system geared toward non-programmers.
          Accessibility is very important... being able to let non-programmers
          get a lot of control.
          <p class="blueheader" align="left"><b>DOUG: How has Lingo evolved from
          your original concept, and where do you expect it to go?</b>
          <p align="left"><img border="0" src="images/intv97_whitedancr.gif" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="4" width="132" height="219">JT:
          With Director 3 and 3.1, Lingo was focused on parity with HyperTalk:
          chunk expressions, floating point, message hierarchy. But that's also
          when the player for Windows came out and there were a lot of problems
          with making Lingo work cross-platform. Lots of stuff to be re-written.
          <p align="left">By the time we got to Director 4, I re-architected
          Lingo on a single codebase that would work cross-platform. Also, we
          changed it to a compiled language, so there was about a 10X
          performance improvement just by compiling the code.
          <p align="left">We just kept expanding it... now there's all the
          netLingo.
          <p class="blueheader" align="left"><b>DOUG: I heard somewhere that a
          huge percentage of Director users never use any Lingo other than
          &quot;go to...&quot;. Why do you think people are so afraid of
          &quot;programming&quot;?</b>
          <p align="left">JT: No matter how easy you make it, there are still
          some concepts there that are not natural. You've got to be exposed to
          it in a logical, step-by-step way or it can be tough. That's what I
          wanted to do with my book. Make this accessible to non-programmers.
          Take them step-by-step through it... After go to, use random to add
          some variety to your animation. Then build up on top of that.
          Appreciate the new experiences...
          <p class="blueheader" align="left"><b>DOUG: What are you proudest of
          with Lingo?</b>
          <p align="left">JT: Proudest of? That any variable can hold any value
          and Lingo can programmatically inspect and evaluate it. It's a fluid
          environment where you don't have to commit to a particular hierarchy
          to message objects. These key features make it easy to experiment.
          Also this gives Lingo alot of expressive power. You can see this most
          dramatically with our Director to Java converter. Simple Lingo scripts
          explode into many lines of Java, so you can see very directly why
          Director is easier to use and much more expressive than Java.
          <p class="blueheader" align="left"><b>DOUG: Tell us what it's like to
          see Director used for all the various applications. What's it like to
          see what people have done with the product? Is it surprising?</b>
          <p align="left">JT: I am surprised how far people have stretched Lingo
          and Director, especially the movies that use 3D and Raycasting
          techniques. They make me scratch my head and think &quot;how did they
          do that?&quot;
          <p align="left">When I go into the bookstores and see all the books or
          surf the web and see somebody's done something in Lingo it's
          inspiring. It makes me realized that there is alot of creative
          potential out there that was just waiting for the right tool. It
          inspires me to keep pushing Director forward so that more people can
          expressive themselves and use the computer creatively.</p>
